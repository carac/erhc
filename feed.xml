<p class="">Can you cure tooth decay naturally?</p>
<p class="">Most of us have experienced some tooth decay in our life, and taking a trip to the dentist where they drill out the decay, fill it back up. And on your way.</p>
<p class="">I invite you to consider this information as I personally know people that have followed this protocol with their kids with great results. If you do have some worrying decay for you or your child, then please do work alongside a holistic dentist that understands</p>

<p class="">these principles, and then together you can track any changes and ensure the decay is subsiding or if other steps need to be taken.</p>

<h2>How modern foods affect oral health</h2>
<p class="">In 1915 there was a dentist name Weston A. Price who was appointed to be the first research director of the American Dental Association.</p>
<p class="">His research let him to various groups of people across the world (e.g. Swiss Also, Aborigines of Australia, Gaelics etc.) that were not yet influenced by the modern Western food changes (white flour, sugars -  processed foods).</p>
<p class="">There he documented the correlation between the absence of tooth decay and other modern lifestyle diseases when they were consuming their traditional diets which were typically very high in fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. Things that are very much lacking in most of our modern diets today, and he said it was a clear sign that most dental decay is not a “genetic” condition.</p>

<h2>Why does food affect oral health?</h2>
<p class="">Food directly impacts your hormones in your body (as does what you put ON your body as I talk about extensively on my <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Healthy Body</a> part of my website). So a key part of this protocol is looking at the food choices we make.</p>
<p class="">Now did you know that hormones and glands also play a role in decay and gum disease? Some experts saying that it doesn’t have anything to do with what food is stuck on your teeth! Understand that this was based on their research of primitive tribes eating their traditional, non-processed diet, but it’s an interesting concept to ponder on seeing that in our current society we’ll happily binge on junk food as long as we brush our teeth before bed…</p>
<p class="">Cholesterol is also a vital building block for hormones, alongside of vitamin D (which is often referred to as a hormone and is fat-soluble).</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"> </p>
<h2>What causes poor oral health?</h2>
<p class="">This is a list from one of the additional resources below, to provide a very brief overall summary of the reasoning behind this particular protocol and point of view:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Dangerous bacteria is not the cause of cavities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Our modern diet is deficient in fat-soluble vitamins and minerals needed for healthy teeth and bones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Tooth decay happens when your body chemistry falls out of balance so your teeth stop remineralising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The imbalance is caused by blood sugar spikes (e.g. modern processed foods) which disrupt your mineral metabolism/absorption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Dentists generally treat the symptoms of dental disease, and treatments usually only have short-term results as remineralising of the cavities is not typically part of the treatment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><br>General recommendations</h2>
<p class="">Here are some very high level recommendations for this protocol, again for more detailed information about why please see below for the additional resources:</p>
<h3>Include:</h3>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Vitamin D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Vitamin A and cod liver oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Bone marrow, bone broth and other organ meats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Organic vegetables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Good quality meats and seafood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Eggs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Healthy fats (butter, organic/wild meats/seafood, coconut oil, olive oil)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Fermented foods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Dairy (organic, raw, whole fat only)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"> </p>
<h3>Exclude:</h3>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Refined sweeteners (high fructose corn syrup etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Processed foods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">* Processed grains (phytic acid inhibits mineral/iron absorption, lectins affect digestion and interferes with hormones)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">** Oats (large amounts can cause scurvy as interferes with vitamin C absorption, modern oats are heat treated so briefly soaking/sprouting doesn’t remove the phytic acid)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Industrial seed oils (trans fats: Canola (from rapeseed), cottonseed, safflower, soy, corn - all labelled as “vegetable oils”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">MSG (Monosodium Glutamate/hydrolized vegetable protein- alters your endocrine gland balance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Soft drinks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""><em>* If grains are consumed ensure they are soaked/sprouted/fermented to minimise the effects on phytic acid and lectins within them.</em></p>
<p class=""><em>** If oats are consumed ensure they are soaked and sprouted for 2 days, dry them, remove the bran, fermented them for 24 hours before consuming and ensure a large amount of fat-soluble foods are present.</em></p>

<p class="">I always try and look at the holistic view, so know that by removing modern foods will not only affect your oral health, but your overall too as most modern dis-eases are caused by some form of inflammation.</p>

                <p>Simple and effective DIY natural cleaning scrub! This can be used on most surfaces when you need an extra bit of cleaning “umph” but gentle enough to use on glass, benches, showers, basins, baths, ovens etc.</p>
<p>No need to buy a different cleaning product for each room in your house either. You really only need a handful of ingredients and your whole house should be covered. Not to mention that making it yourself saves you not only $$, but you also know EXACTLY what’s in there and know that it’s safe to use around the house and not mess up your hormones…</p>
<p>Even more important if you have babies, kids or pets - anything they touch, gets absorbed into their bodies and it can get overloaded much more easily than us adults and cause both short term and long term health effects.</p>
<p>Here’s one of the easiest and quickest DIY’s, I find it fun making them, and even a little more fun cleaning with too ;-)</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2-3 tablespoons bicarb soda</li>
<li>10 drops <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Thieves essential oil</a> blend (cuts through dirt, keeps mould at bay and defends and protects!)</li>
<li>5 drops <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Lemon essential oil</a> (great degreaser)</li>
<li>Re-use a herb bottle (anything that has a sprinkler top)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add the bicarb soda into your bottle (the bottle I used is ~40g when it was filled with dried herbs).</li>
<li>Add in the essential oils and gently shake to disperse the oils in the bicarb soda.</li>
<li>Optional - re-use some packing paper to create your own label.</li>
<li>Shake onto the desired area, and either use a damp cloth to scrub or use your all-purpose Thieves Household Cleaner spray to spray it and then scrub.</li>
</ol>

                <p>If you’re someone that finds it difficult to find some shower time, let alone hair washing time… then this is for you! I discovered it a few months ago and am in love with it! It’s the perfect way to quickly get some oiliness out of your hair.</p>
<p>But for busy mamas and people, more importantly it’s super easy to make and so cheap!. AND this easy DIY version also doesn’t contain any nasty toxins that can be in commercial spray-on dry shampoos - like Butane, Propane or Fragrance (typically 100-1000’s of chemicals hidden under trade secret trademarks).</p>
<p>Here’s some other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenient, cheap, quick and easy!</li>
<li>Balances hair oil production</li>
<li>Travel friendly - light and no liquids</li>
<li>Helps prevent premature greying (as you’re not using any hash chemicals!)</li>
<li>Adds volume and texture to your hair</li>
</ul>
<p>I also added some hair loving essential oils - Lavender, Cedarwood and Rosemary. But - you could add any combination that you enjoy too, any excuse to make it into a mini-aromatherapy session!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup Arrowroot/tapioca powder</li>
<li>1 tbsp Bi-carb soda</li>
<li>Cacao (optional for those with darker hair)</li>
<li>2 drops of <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Lavender Essential Oil</a></li>
<li>2 drops of <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Cedarwood Essential Oil</a></li>
<li>2 drops of <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Rosemary  Essential Oil</a></li>
<li>1 small jar (with a sprinkle top ideal)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Add the arrowroot/tapioca powder and bi-carb into your jar and shake to combine well.</p>
<p>For those with darker hair, slowly add in small amounts of cacao. Know that the colour of the finished powder doesn’t have to match your hair colour, just a small amount of tint is fine just to allow it to blend a little rather than the bright arrowroot/bi-carb otherwise. For example I only add in 1 teaspoon of cacao for my brown/dark blonde hair. Shake until combined.</p>
<p>Add in your essential oils and shake well.</p>
<p>To apply just grab a pinch from your jar (or sprinkle directly onto your hair) and massage into your roots focusing on the more oily parts of your hair (do this over a sink!). I like to then comb it through the rest of my hair using my fingers and get rid of any excess. Repeat until you’re happy with the effect and you’re confident to head back out in public ;-)</p>

                <p>LOVING my simple all Natural Bleach spray!</p>
<p>Did you know that traditional bleach has a host of potential effects on our bodies? The most common being impacts on the respiratory systems and skin irritation. But the real dangers are when you mix it with other chemicals like ammonia, acidic cleaners. alchohol… and even water.</p>
<p>When they are combined it can create toxic gases and cause symptoms like ear/nose/throat irritation, breathing issues, burning eyes - but these can then lead to chest pain, pneumonia, fluid in the lungs…even to death.</p>
<p>All while you just wanted to clean your shower or toilet bowl!</p>
<p>Oh and the EPA has even recommended to eliminate suggesting bleach to help clean mould as it’s been shown to actually ENCOURAGE the growth of toxic mould.</p>
<p>Game over!</p>
<p>After I read this I was definitely interested in finding a safer solution not only for us doing the cleaning, but for my kiddos when they’re TOUCHING the surfaces after they’ve been cleaned!</p>
<p>Enter… Hydrogen Peroxide. A safe bleach alternative which keeps things white and disinfects… without all those dangers.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of uses for this so I’ve just included 2 of my favourites here. A stain remover spray which I uses in the laundry on my clothes and as a deep cleaning spray in the bathroom, and a soft scrub for for those places that need some extra attention like the bath tub, sink, shower and toilet bowl!</p>
