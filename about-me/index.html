The health outcomes were undeniable and amazing for both my husband and I, and this led me to become an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach. After this I had to share my passion, knowledge and experience about how food and lifestyle choices can affect your life.</p><p>I received my training from the <a href="http://www.integrativenutrition.com/">Institute for Integrative Nutrition</a>, where I was exposed to many dietary theories and studied a variety of practical lifestyle coaching methods. Drawing on this knowledge, I will help you create a completely personalised ‚Äúroadmap to health‚Äù that suits your unique body, lifestyle, preferences, and goals. <a href="http://geti.in/1xyTfYC">Click here</a> to find out more information and get the IIN curriculum guide.</p><h3>Healthy and low-toxin living</h3><p>After having kids (1 beautiful girl and 1 cheeky boy!) my passion expanded into low-toxin living after I was shocked at the amount of toxic chemicals that were in baby products. I began supporting our health using natural options‚Ä¶and they worked. I strive to live a low-toxin life as much as is within my control, so I also guide and educate about how you can transition to a low-toxin environment.</p><p>During my research for natural options, one tool I discovered was <a href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/essential-oils/">Young Living's essential oils</a> as these resonated with me at every level and worked extremely effectively for me and my family. When you can calm down your 2 year old in the middle of the night after applying some oils you begin to take notice! They also spiced up my cleaning ritual so my house didn‚Äôt just smell of bi-carb and vinegar ;-)</p><h3>Identifying and releasing emotional patterns</h3><p>In 2018 I also became a Certified Aroma Freedom Technique (AFT) Practitioner, which is based on various Psychology modalities and ¬†uses the power of scent of specific pure essential oils to gently shift awareness away from negative thoughts, feelings, and memories, and to initiate a positive outlook and anchor permanent shifts and attitude resulting in greater confidence, clarity and inner freedom.</p><p>What I love in particular about this modality, is that you can use this process on yourself. I love empowering people and showing them tools that they can use themselves for their own self-care! If you like the sound of this, then get in touch to get the oils required, and I will teach you how to do this.</p><p>In my spare time, I am also Craig's loving wife, and one of his <a href="http://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/">Stretch Therapy and Zenthai Shiatsu</a> students which focuses around holistic bodywork and self-care work.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2024 Emmely Rackemann</div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/EmmelyRackemannHealthCoaching" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="http://instagram.com/emmelyrackemann" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/üåª-emmely-rackemann-a553b14/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://carac.github.io/erhc/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://carac.github.io/erhc/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script src="https://carac.github.io/erhc/media/plugins/pagePrefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
